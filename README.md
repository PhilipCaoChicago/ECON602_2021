### Tasks:
1. [Install Julia, VS Code, and Julia extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/) (Do all)
2. [Install Git, sign up for Github, and do some basic operations](https://julia.quantecon.org/software_engineering/version_control.html) (Do everything to the end of 11.3 and read through the rest)

### Goals:
At the end of this tutorial, you should have:
1. Julia running via VS Code,
2. Git installed,
3. a Github account, and
4. an idea of how version control and collaboration works with Git/Github.

If there is time left, we'll move on to some basic programming.
